## Download and install

Grab the latest build from the [Releases page](https://github.com/serrebidev/BlindRSS/releases).
For a version-by-version history, see the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md).

**Windows installer (recommended)**

1. Download `BlindRSS-Setup-vX.Y.Z.exe`.
2. Run it and approve the elevation prompt. It installs to Program Files, adds a Start Menu entry, and updates itself in place.

**Windows portable**

1. Download `BlindRSS-vX.Y.Z.zip`.
2. Extract it anywhere and run `BlindRSS.exe` — no installation required.

**macOS and Linux**

Download the matching `…-macos.zip` or `…-linux.tar.gz` asset from the same release.

Installed builds keep your settings and database in `%APPDATA%\BlindRSS` and default episode downloads to your Downloads folder. Uninstalling leaves your data untouched.

## Run from source (any OS)

1. Install Python 3.14.
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Launch it: `python main.py`

## Building

See [`build.md`](build.md) for the full release pipeline — PyInstaller packaging, Authenticode signing, the Program Files installer, and the macOS/Linux build dispatch.

## Debug logging

Enable debug mode in Settings to write a rotating `blindrss.log` (DEBUG and above) next to your config and data. With debug mode off, no log file is created.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. If BlindRSS has been useful to you, open a PR with a fix or feature and I'll review it.

## Translations

I only speak English, so I got several languages started with AI-assisted translation rather than leaving them untranslated. Human translation is always preferred, and I'd rather have a native speaker's review than a machine's best guess.

If you speak one of the supported languages and something reads wrong, awkward, or just off, please open a PR to fix it — I can't judge the wording myself, so I'll almost certainly accept it. See [`locale/README.md`](locale/README.md) for how the translation files are laid out and how to update them.
