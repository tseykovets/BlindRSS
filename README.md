  # BlindRSS

BlindRSS is a screen-reader-friendly desktop RSS and podcast app. It is built for fast feed reading and reliable audio playback.

## What BlindRSS Does

- Reads RSS/Atom feeds and plays podcast/video enclosures.
- Supports local feeds plus hosted providers: Miniflux, Inoreader, The Old Reader, and BazQux.
- Includes All/Unread/Read/Favorites views, plus mark read/unread and mark all read.
- Extracts full article text when feeds only provide summaries.
- Finds feeds from URLs and search providers (Apple Podcasts, gPodder, Feedly, NewsBlur, Reddit, Fediverse, Feedsearch, and local discovery).
- Supports YouTube, Rumble, and Odysee URL discovery/media handling through yt-dlp and local resolvers.
- Uses a local range-cache proxy for faster seeking and smoother VLC playback.
- Casts to Chromecast, DLNA/UPnP, and AirPlay.
- Supports tray controls, media keys, saved searches, and startup restore of your last selected feed/folder.
- Supports Windows notifications for new articles with per-feed exclusions and per-refresh limits.
- Includes a built-in updater that verifies SHA-256 and Authenticode before applying updates.
