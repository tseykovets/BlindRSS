Full-text article extraction using trafilatura.

Goal:
- Given an article URL, extract clean text (no ads/boilerplate) plus title and author.
- Follow simple multi-page pagination (rel=next / next links) and merge text.
- Provide safe fallbacks for feed items without a webpage URL (e.g., podcast episodes).
