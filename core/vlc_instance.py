"""Shared libVLC instance, created once and warmed on a background thread.

libVLC instance creation scans and loads every plugin DLL (BlindRSS passes
--no-plugins-cache, so there is no cache to shortcut the scan). On frozen
Windows builds with a bundled VLC this takes multiple seconds, and doing it on
the wx main thread froze the whole app whenever playback started without a
live player window: the first play of a session, and every play after the
player window was closed (closing used to release the instance). Keeping one
instance for the process lifetime and creating it off-thread keeps the UI
responsive while audio is being prepared.

``import vlc`` stays inside the creation path so importing this module never
loads libVLC.
