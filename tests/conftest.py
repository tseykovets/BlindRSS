"""Shared test-suite guards.

The full-text and feed paths both escalate to `core.browser_feed`, which starts a
real (serialized, several-second) Chromium session. A unit test that mocks HTTP
would otherwise sail past its mock into that launch and hit the live network, so
the escalation is disabled for the whole suite. Tests that exercise the browser
fallback deliberately can monkeypatch `core.browser_feed` themselves.

The managed cookie jar is redirected for the same reason: request behavior now
depends on whether the jar holds a session for the host under test (a pinned
User-Agent forces a matching TLS fingerprint), so a suite reading the developer's
real jar would pass or fail based on which sites they happen to have visited.
`test_impersonation_falls_through_to_safari_fingerprint` really did start failing
on a machine whose owner had browsed neowin.net.
