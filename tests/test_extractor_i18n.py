"""Extraction messages must translate at raise time, not import time (PR #69).

core.article_extractor is imported (via gui.mainframe) from main.py's import
block, which runs BEFORE main.py calls i18n.setup(). Any module-level
``MSG = _("...")`` therefore captures the English NullTranslations fallback
permanently -- which is precisely why PR #69's translations never appeared even
though its ru catalog was correct.

These tests pin the two halves of the fix: the messages resolve through a live
catalog installed AFTER import, and no module-level constant re-freezes them.
