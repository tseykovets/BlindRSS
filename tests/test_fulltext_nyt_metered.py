"""New York Times (DataDome + metered paywall) full-text and rich-view regressions.

NYT refuses every plain and TLS-impersonated request with a DataDome 403 and is
refused outright by the read-proxies, so the invisible-browser escalation is the
only way the reader ever sees the page. Once fetched, two more things used to go
wrong: the rich view deleted the whole article, and a truncated free preview was
shown as if it were the complete story.
