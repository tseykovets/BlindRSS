"""Regression: repeated extraction of the same article must not shrink.

trafilatura's ``deduplicate`` option counts paragraph sightings in a
process-global LRU shared by every extract call. With it enabled, extracting
the same article a few times (precision + recall passes, accessible-browser
prefetch + on-demand loads, plain revisits) made trafilatura drop the
article's own paragraphs as "duplicates": the first extractions returned the
full text, then later ones collapsed to a short stub. On macOS this presented
as "full text doesn't work" because the VoiceOver accessible browser
re-extracts aggressively. The extractor must therefore keep deduplicate off.
