"""Classic full-text view must keep short standalone lines (issue: Android Authority).

_merge_texts had a sub-25-char paragraph floor that ran on EVERY extraction,
not just read-proxy markdown. On HTML-extracted text it silently ate plain
short headings — e.g. the "FootballGPT" and "Sofascore" h3 lines in Android
Authority's World Cup AI roundup — while both names still appeared inside body
sentences, which made naive substring checks pass. The floor is now opt-in
(drop_short_paragraphs) and only the proxy-markdown path uses it.
