"""Regression: MacRumors full text must not merge the next-article teaser (issue: full-text
view showed the real article followed by text from OTHER articles).

MacRumors article pages carry a "Next Article" teaser in the sidebar whose anchor text is the
NEXT STORY'S HEADLINE (e.g. "Next Year's iPhone Air 2 to Feature Four Key Upgrades"). The old
pagination heuristic in _find_next_page matched "next" as a substring anywhere in anchor text,
so that teaser was treated as page 2 of the current article and the unrelated story's full body
was fetched and appended.

The fixture is a real MacRumors article page (2026-07-08, "Apple to Drop Support for Encrypted
Mac OS Extended Drives Next Year"), stripped of scripts/styles/nav but keeping the article body,
the JSON-LD block, the Popular Stories / Top Rated Comments blocks, and BOTH next-article
anchors (the data-track="next-article" one and the plain headline-text one). No network is used.
